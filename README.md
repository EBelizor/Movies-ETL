# Movies-ETL

## Background

In this project, I will be creating an ETL pipeline that will transform raw data into an SQL database. Python will be used to extract the data from their sources, I will be scraping data from wikipedia for all movies released after the year 1990, and movie ratings data from the movie lands website hosted by kaggle. With the power of pandas, I was able to load the data into a dataframe in order to clean and transform the data. With the use of regular expressions through python, I was also able load my data into SQL from my jupyter notebook.
